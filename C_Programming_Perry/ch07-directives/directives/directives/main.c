/*
 * Making your programs more powerful with 'preprocessor directives'
 * Preprocessor directives don't cause anything to happen at runtimee.
 * They work during the compiling phase of the program.
 *
 * It works as a file merge: The contents of the filename specified replaces
 * the statement where the `#include` happens.
 *
 * The filename is often a header file ending with extension '.h'
 * Use <> when the filename is part of the C libraries
 * Use "" when you are the author of the header file.
 *
 * "" causes the compiler to begin search for filename staring with current
 * directory.
 *
 * The `#define` directive lets you give names to literals, defined as constants
 * NOTE: Constants defined with `#define` are not variables.
 *
 *  `#define _CONSTANTNAME_ _constantDefinition_`
 *
 * Defined constants are useful for values that remain the same during one
 * program execution, but still might need to change with each execution.
