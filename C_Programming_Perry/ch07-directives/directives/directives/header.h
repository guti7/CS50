// Sample Header file

// If you have certain values that wll not change (or only change rarely)
// You can set them with `#define` statements.
// If you plan to use them in several programs, you can place them in a
// header file

#define KIDS 3
#define FAMILY "The Peytons"
#define MORTGAGE_RATE 5.15

// notice there are no semicolons at the end (it is not a C statement)
