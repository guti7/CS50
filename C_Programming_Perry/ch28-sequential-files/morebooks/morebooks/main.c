/*
 * By now you know how to create, read, and write sequential files to disk.
 *
 * When reading from a file, check for the end-of-file condition to ensure
 * that you don't try to read past the end of the file.
 *
 * Use built-in function `feof` to check for the end-of-file
 * Don't read from a file without first checking if you have reaached the end
 * first.
