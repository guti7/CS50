/*
 * The C 'structure' is a way by which you group data and get
 * access to all the individual parts known as 'members'.
 *
 * Structure definition:
 * Before you can declare variables of your structure, you
 * need to tell your program what your structure looks like by defining it.
 *
 * A structure definition can be considered as an aggregate type, it has a name
 * and can be considered a single value. It serves as a blueprint.
 *
 * `struct` keyword begins the structure definition
 *
 * ````````````````````````
 *  struct [structureTag] { // the structure tag: the assigned new 'data type'
 *      member; // regular built-in data type definitions
 *      member;
 *      ...
 *      member;
 *  };
