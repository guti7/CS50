/*
 * A 'structure' is an aggregate variable data type.
 * A structure can hold several values of different data types
 *
 * Before using a structure variable, you must define the `struct`
 * `struct` signals how many members are in the structure and the
 * data typ of each member
 *
 * Member names exist only so you can work witha an indivual part of the
 * structure. Do not use member names as regular variables
