/*
 * Random files let you skip around in the file, reading and writing
 * at any point you access.
 *
 * In C, a file is a stream of bytes, and the way you access it isn't linked
 * to any format of the file.
 *
 * Random-Access `fopen` modes - "r+", "w+", "a+",
 * All write and read to and from the file, but they differ on what you need
 * to with the file:
 * "r+" if the file already exists,
 * "w+" overwrites or creates a file,
 * "a+" appends to the end of file,
 *
 * `fseek` lets you move around within a file by moving the file pointer
 * so you read and write at nonsequential places.
 * `fseek (filePointer, longValue, origin)`
 * use only on random access files, i.e. files you open with '+' access
 *
 * One of the advantages of random access files is that you can write and reread
 * the data just added without having to close and open the file.
